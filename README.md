Openly Extensible License 1.01

I created this license to share my game asset in an open way

The mindset behind it is that I can make some *pocket money* (Boooh I know) by selling them, and people can use it is their commercial game, but they can't share back or sell my asset.
But I like stuff that belong to everybody, so at any moment, I can change the license to a more permissive one, ie : allowing people to redistribute and sell them.
